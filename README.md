# Vue createContext

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vue-create-context.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/vue-create-context)

An abstracted util factory for creating **scoped**, **declarative**, and **reactive** context-components in Vue. This API abstraction is greatly inspired by [`React.createContext`](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) using Vue's [`prvide/inject` API](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#provide-inject) under the hood. The usage and its behaviour is exactly the same as you may expect if you already familiar with React. With this library to power up your Vue application, you then now able to use `prvide/inject` in an explicit, but declarative manner for managing application contexts using component composition. It's just that easy.

## üß∞ Requirements

This library recommend to have Vue 2.6+, where Vue introduces the `v-slot` derivative, opening a clean declarative pattern for passing component props in a compositional manner.

## üé¨ Getting started

To get it started, add this package into your project:

```bash
yarn add vue-create-context
```

## üìî API

### `createContext`

```js
import { createContext } from 'vue-create-context';
const MyContext = createContext(defaultValue);
```

Calling `createContext` with the `defaultValue` to create a context object. The `defaultValue` can be either a referential object or primitive, which is **ONLY** used when the `Consumer` component can not find its conjugated `Provider` above the rendering tree.

### `Context.Provider`

```vue
<MyContext.Provider value={/* the provided value */}>
```

The `Provider` accept a `value` prop to be any value you want it to pass down the rendering tree. Similar to React, you can use this component multiple times an any level of the tree. Its conjugated `Consumer` will receive the value from the closest `Provider` among its ancestors.

Note: If the provided value is reactive, update this value "reactively" will also update all its subscribed descended `Consumers`. Also, make the value `undefined` (either explicitly passed in or implicitly set to) **WON'T** letting `Consumer` to use the `defaultValue`, which is the same as in React.

### `Context.Consumer`

```vue
<MyContext.Consumer v-slot="/* slot props: the value injected by the closed Provider */">
  /* you can access the value within the block */
  /* note: as a normal renderless component, this block have no access to computed properties */
</MyContext.Consumer>
```

The `Consumer` gives the access to the injected value from the closest `Provider`. Unlike React, where uses the CAAF (children as a function, also known as the "render prop") pattern to access the value, we uses `v-slot` inside the component block template to access the value (the so called "slot props"). If you uses single file component (SFC) or browsers supports ES6+ object spread operator, you can take the advantage of object destructuring (see more on [Vue's official documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-slots.html#Destructuring-Slot-Props)).

It is worth to mention that due to the current implementation of Vue's scoped slot API, the slot props have to be an object, so it is recommended to give the value as an plan old javascript object (POJO). In the case of the provided value to be a primitive, it will be normalized as an object with a `value` key to get the passed value in `v-slot`, i.e. `{ value: /* your provided value */ }`.

Note: You might be tempted to mutate the injected value from the consumer block. This is generally a bad idea since it violate the principle of "[props down, event up](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/#Implicit-parent-child-communication-use-with-caution)"; therefore, it is recommend to treat the slot props as read only properties. Under the hood, this reactivity behaviour of slot props is just a reflection of the `provide/inject` API.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Caveat**: After chat with Vue's core team member @linusborg in Discord, the current constrain limits the template inside `Consumer` block have no access to the computed properties, but it can access to state value defined in `data` though.  Please use it with caution!

## üíé Example

There is a story in [the Official Storybook Vue](https://monorepo-git-add-addon-contextsvue-i.storybook.now.sh/examples/vue-kitchen-sink/?path=/story/addon-contexts--languages) as an example of the `createContexts`.

For people using the SFC format, here is an conceptual example.

#### SomeContext.js

```js
import { createContext } from 'vue-create-context';
export const CurrentUserContext = createContext({ firstName: 'Null', lastName: 'Unknown' });
```

#### SomeComponent.vue

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <!-- ... -->
    <Consumer v-slot="{ firstName, lastName }">
      <!-- Do something, where firstName, lastName is destructured from the received value -->
    </Consumer>
    <!-- ... -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { Consumer } from './SomeContext';

module.exports = {
  name: 'SomeComponent',
  components: {
    Consumer,
  },
};
</script>
```

#### App.vue

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <Provider :value="user">
      <div>
        <SomeComponent />
        <!-- Consumer in the above component get { firstName: 'Jack', lastName: 'Newman' } -->
        <Provider value="{ firstName: 'Amy', lastName: 'Smith' }">
          <SomeComponent />
          <!-- Consumer in the above component get { firstName: 'Amy', lastName: 'Smith' } -->
        </Provider>
      </div>
    </Provider>
    <SomeComponent />
    <!-- Consumer in the above component get { firstName: 'Null', lastName: 'Unknown' } -->
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { Provider } from './SomeContext';
import SomeComponent from './SomeComponent';

module.exports = {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    Provider,
    SomeComponent,
  },
  data() {
    return {
      user: {
        firstName: 'Jack',
        lastName: 'Newman',
      },
    };
  },
};
</script>
```
